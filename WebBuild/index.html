                        <h2>Milestone 0</h2> 
                        <h3><strong>Changed I made:</strong>
                        	<p>- Added fire weapon that deals high damage. Enemies move faster when hit.</p>
                            <p>- Added Ice weapon that deals lower damage than fire weapon. Enemies move slower when hit.</p>
                            <p>- Added Confusion weapon that deals very low damage. Enemies move to attack each other. No score is gained when enemies kill each other.</p>
                            <p>- Added weapon energy bar (bottom middle) that depletes as weapon is used.</p>
                            <p>- Enemies will change material and display particle effects when hit by picked up weapons</p>
                            <br/>
                        </h3>
                        <h3><strong>Instructions:</strong>
                        	<p>- Play the game like normal.</p>
                            <p>- Pickups will spawn randomly in about 8 different locations every 3 seconds, and wll be destroyed after 5 seconds. Simply run over one to pick one up. You will see a particle effect should you get it (to differentiate it despawning while you were very close).</p>
                            <p>- You will then be able to fire the weapon for a total of 5 seconds while the fire button is held down (indicated by the bottom middle bar).</p>
                            <p>- Enemies that are affected by a weapon will not be affected by another until the first wears off. In addition, hitting the enemies with the same pickup weapon will not do extra damage.</p>
                        	<br/>
                        </h3>
                        <h3><strong>Issues:</strong>
                        	<p>- The only issue present is that the enemies are being hit based off of a collider in front of the player. This works fine, but the particles don't move as fast as the collider, so you may see some particles hit enemies that don't do anything if they are far away. The distance is pretty accurate, but not while you are moving. I would change this, if I had enough time, to "shoot" colliders instead of having one static collider. Then, the colliders would move more in sync with the particle systems.
                            </p>

                        <h2>Milestone 1</h2> 
                        <p><em>***Note: My submission folder contains a readme.txt file that is formatted to the specifications in the rubric. The section below can be used as a general reference.</em></p>
                        <h3><strong>Instructions:</strong>
                        	<p><em>You can use keyboard controls:</em></p>
                            <p>- W/S to move forward and backward</p>
                            <p>- A/D to turn left and right (while moving forward or backward)</p>
                            <p>- Space to jump (while on ground)</p>
                            <br/>
                            <p><em>You can also use a controller:</em></p>
                            <p>- Left stick vertical to move forward and backward</p>
                            <p>- Left stick horizontal to move left and right (while moving forward or backward)</p>
                            <p>- A to jump (while on ground)</p>
                        	<br/>
                        </h3>
                        <h3><strong>Requirements:</strong>
                            <p>- New level created with trees and rocks</p>
                            <p>- Character is our main character created from Mixamo (although she is missing the proper attire technically)</p>
                            <p>- Input parameter for the animation controller are Forward/Backward, Left/Right, and Jump</p>
                            <p>- States include: Idle, Move Forward, Move Backward, Jump and NON input states: Fall and Land</p>
                            <p>- Two blend trees in move state: One for turning and another for speed. One blend tree in Backwards for speed</p>
                            <p>- Player controller script controlling the movemets (series of components as I believe is best practice)</p>
                            <br/>
                        </h3>
                        <h3><strong>Issues:</strong>
                        	<p>- I have confirmed the controller is working on PC. Input manager should correctly switch between the platforms, but I'm not sure how it handles in the web player across different platforms. Please let me know if it does not work.</p>
                            <p>- The Input manager I use allows the game to switch from keyboard to gamepad controls at runtime, but sometimes it takes a few taps of some buttons to get it to register controller input. If the controller is not working, this may be the case.</p>
                            <p>- I had some trouble with binding the skeleton to this mesh because it came from another mesh. As a result, some body parts are distorted at the moment (like feet).</p>
                            <p>- I had no fall animation to put in, so I freeze the animation while in the air. This causes a rough transition of animations when the player lands. You will most likely see the player floating for a moment before she puts her feet on the ground.</p>
                            <p>- You can escape the ring of rocks in the level. Please don't.</p>
                            <p>- The player is set to be able to jump again after they land if they land on a spot that is not too steep. This causes a bug when you are standing right next to a rock where you can't jump anymore.</p>
                            <p>- I have a separate animation for running right/left in the game, but due to a weird Unity bug of not applying root motion to my animations, I have to manually turn the player, so she looks a bit slidey.</p>

                            <p>- Hold right mouse to grow a bubble and left mouse to shoot the bubble. The mouse can be used to aim while a bubble is being blown</p>

                        </h3>
                        <h3><strong>Team Requirements:</strong>
                            <p>- General physical interactions</p>
                            <p>- Collider animation wehen crawling</p>
                            <p>- Ragdoll simulation (step off the map in scene 2 or press 'P' key)</p>
                            <p>- Game Feel: We created a girl who is a spy and jumps. She has very exaggerated jumps which are very fun to make, especially when bouncing high off tramplines. She can also shoot out pieces of bubblegum that act as bouncy objects.</p>
                            <br/>
                        </h3>
                        <h3><strong>Issues:</strong>
                        	<p>- Most of the issues lie with the sliding mechanic. One of our character controller is causing very strange issues.</p>
                            <p>- The pushing can sometimes be decoupled.</p>
                            <p>- Trying to shoot a piece of gum while in the air will throw a null pointer exception.</p>
                            <p>- The camera can be a bit flinchy.</p>
                            <p>- The camera can get stuck underground if you aim too high while shooting a piece of gum.</p>
                            <p>- Some of the crawling colliders are a little off</p>
                            <p>- The crawling animation has a visual glitch</p>
                            <p>- Pushing does not work in the web build</p>
                            <p>- The colliders for the bubblegum are off intentionally. This is to give the illusion of deformation and absorbsion as the player hits them.</p>

                        <h3><strong>Issues:</strong>
                        	<p>- The menu system is not complete (art or functionality). You may not be able to use a controller yet, and the navigation is not setup properly. Please just use a mouse for now. There is also no title art.</p>
							<p>- The menu will also not resize the UI properly when resolution is changed, but nothing should be distorted.</p>
							<p>- The Janitor sometimes doesn’t run to the bubble, but he does still go to the bubble.</p>
							<p>- The Janitor doesn’t actually “pop” a bubble. Right now, he just touches it and destroys it.</p>
                            <p>- When a cop detects the player, the NPC is supposed to play the “hey” sound once, but the sound gets played multiple times sometimes.</p>
							<p>- The derpy cop with the original b-tree (Btree_Derp) got stuck between two nodes of his waypoint network. He is currently using Btree_Derp2 which no longer causes that problem. It is messier and less graceful way of switching his animations, but it gets the job done.</p>

                            <p>- Introduction Menu</p>
                            <p>- Title Screen Background</p>

                        <h3><strong>Issues:</strong>
                        	<p>- Animation may seem ‘slippery’ for now.</p>
							<p>- The menu will also not resize the UI properly when resolution is changed, but nothing should be distorted.</p>
							<p>- The Pause Menu is ever so slightly misaligned from the center.</p>
							<p>- I’m not actually sure if a controller will work properly in a Webplayer on Macs.</p>
                            <p>- Rotating the camera with a controller will also rotate the character for some reason.</p>
							<p>- Didn’t want to show the bubble pop effect when the bubble cancels blowing the bubble, as it is not destroyed technically (the num bubbles remaining is kept the same). But I’m not sure if this is confusing.</p>
                            <p>- When the game starts, the landing effect gets activated immediately even though it is not supposed to call for it until Time.time is greater than 3.</p>
                            <p>- Although the two particle systems for the landing effect has two different colors, it is very hard to distinguish between the two. Particle System 1 is a white color, and Particle System 2 is a grayish brown color.</p>
